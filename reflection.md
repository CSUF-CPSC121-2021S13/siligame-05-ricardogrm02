# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
For this milestone we adapted our code to be more compatible with pointers. We dynamically allocated memory for our game element objeccts and deleted them when we no longer needed them. We also added a score counter and a game over screen.
## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
One of the challenges I encountered was allocating memeory for the game element objects. I'd run into certain memory overflows and address leaks.

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
The most important thing I learned from this milestone was how create unique pointers and how to dynamically allocate memory for them in the heap. I also learned how to change the ownership of
